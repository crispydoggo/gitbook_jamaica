# Jamaica’s profile {#section4}

Jamaica is the third largest island of the Caribbean islands, and the largest English-speaking Island in the Caribbean Sea, as well as one of the most populated ones with 2.961 million people. The country was a Spanish settlement from 1494 to 1655, when it was occupied by the English and was a British colony from 1707 to 1962. Under the English domain, the island became the primary exporter of sugar. In 1962, Jamaica declared its independence, however it remained a member of the Commonwealth, making the country a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government.

As a constitutional monarchy, the Executive power is vested in three figures: the head of State, a governor-general and a prime minister. The head of State is represented by the British monarch, currently exercised by Queen Elizabeth II. The governor-general is appointed by the monarch and has mostly ceremonial power and acts as a representative; Sir Patrick L. Allen has occupied this position since 2006. And finally, the head of the government is the prime minister, who is appointed by the leading political party from its parliamentary members- The constitution stipulates a five year-term for the Senate and the House of Representatives, this term applies to the selection of the prime minister. The prime minister position has been occupied by Andrew Holness, leader of the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP), since 2016. 


The legislative branch is divided in two chambers: the House of Representatives, composed of 63 members, elected through universal vote for a five-year term; and the Senate, which has a total of 21 members appointed by the governor general, 13 on the advice of the prime minister, and 8 on the advice of the opposition leader. Two-thirds of both chambers is needed for major constitutional amendments.

Since its independence, Jamaica has alternated between the two major political parties, the social-democratic People's National Party (PNP) and the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP), however, each instance of change has been followed by a minimum of two successive periods in which the majority party stays in office. This has signified somewhat political stability for Jamaica since most cabinet ministers and other government officials stay in office for longer periods of time than their counterparts in other Latin-American countries.

In 2020, the Prime Minister called for early elections with the purpose of ensuring a united response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The JLP got the majority, receiving 57% of the votes and winning 49 seats. The PNP remained the opposition party, losing 16 seats. Besides the obvious economic and health challenges derived from the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the biggest challenges the government has faced in late years have been the high rate of youth unemployment, poverty and crime and violence levels.

Regarding the foreign policy of the country, Jamaica is active in multilateral forums, such as the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS), as well as being member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Association of Caribbean States; both memberships have allowed the country to strengthen its ties with other Caribbean countries as well as facilitated economic and diplomatic cooperation.

Jamaica is also an important promoter at the international level for status’ review of small countries whose condition as middle-income countries prevents their access to funds under preferential conditions and aims for international institutions to take into consideration the particular characteristics and vulnerabilities that insular countries face and are exposed to^[BBC News.

##	Jamaica’s RBM profile

Jamaica is considered the RBM Champion in the Caribbean region. The country has made many efforts that have served as a guide for the rest of the countries, and it is considered a leader in this matter. According to the Preparedness Diagnostic results, Jamaica seeks to have a fully functional RBM system in place to strengthen the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) accountability, to incorporate better and more recurrent evidence in the processes of decision making regarding planning, budgeting and implementation in order to:

1. improve performance;

2. measure the results and impacts of policies and programmes; 

3. each MDA to become the leader in their respective sector of action (e.g. health, telecommunications, energy, etc.) and work vis-à-vis the private sector; and 

4. reduce duplication of actions and waste of resources (financial and human). 


There have been great steps in creating and strengthening Jamaica's RBM system. For example from the institutional side, branches/units and other institutions were created within the government to formalize the planning and execution of the RBM system, as is the case of the Performance Management and Evaluation Branch. From the regulatory side, since 2005, frameworks and regulatory documents have been developed, modified and strengthened to improve the planning and budgeting of MDAs, such as the case of the Medium-Term Results-Based Budgeting (MTRBB) Framework, that seeks to align budget to the planning and results (both intended and achieved), the Public Investment Management System (PIMS), intended to strengthen Public Investment Management through the development of a unified set of procedures, guidelines and requirements established to govern all public investments, the Strategic Business Plans that seek guide the actions of the MDAs towards the achievement of the goals established in the National Development Plan (Vision 2030), the Employee Performance Management System and Policy (EPMS & EPMP), the Performance Management and Appraisal System (PMAS), the Performance Management Evaluation Framework (PMEF) and the Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System (PMES, the main tool for RBM within MDAs), among many other. The GoJ has also reached out to international organisations, as well as to other countries, to seek support and to exchange best practices regarding M&E and RBM.


Despite the GoJ’s efforts mentioned above regarding planning, budgeting, and performance management, there seem to be significant deficiencies in articulating them to better implement, evaluate, and improve GoJ´s policies, programmes, and projects. Regarding implementation, the GoJ Jamaica, as well as CARICOM, are associated with a deficit in terms of policies, programs, projects, and processes (planning, budgeting, adjustments, etc.). This deficit can be seen through the progress rates of the implementation of programs, which are usually around 60% , and whose terms of reference, plans and timeframes are often postponed, generating losses of resources and a lack of confidence of investors and donors in government. In addition, the deficit translates into a sharp decrease in the government's capacity to meet the demands of citizens, as well as the public problems that most afflict the country. In turn, the government's accountability and effectiveness undermine its position vis-a-vis the private, external sectors, and international aid.

For these reasons, the GoJ has prioritized the development and strengthening of its RBM system, to use the evidence generated from the system to improve decision-making and at the same time improve planning, budgeting, and the achievement of the results. In this sense, the Office of the Cabinet has been working on an RBM Policy that integrates all the efforts previously made and thus consolidates a comprehensive system that leverages the resources generated, now and in the future. According to this diagnosis, this RBM Policy will be comprehensive, coherent, exhaustive, and useful for the GoJ for identifying the main actions to be carried out to have a strong RBM system in place.

As mentioned before, having a whole-of-government RBM system in place and running will have effects on different processes, being planning and budgeting two of the most relevant ones. The GoJ has clearly defined planning and budgeting processes (see [**Appendix C**](#appendixC)) that should be considered as the national RBM policy is developed; this will help identify specific needs and guide the RBM policy towards its use. The overall national planning and budgeting processes are briefly explained below:



### National planning process

Jamaica's planning process is consistent over time and identifies the times, resources, and personnel necessary to carry it out. The process can be synthesized as follows:

1.	The Cabinet determines the priorities of the Government for the short and medium terms based on the National Development Plan Vision 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the Government’s political objectives (usually before September 30). 

2.	The Office of the Cabinet at the same time issues a circular of "Planning Call" (Performance Management Operating Policy and Procedures) document for the Four-Year Strategic Business and Operational Plans that are aligned to the budget and priorities of the Government.

3.	MDAs are required to submit Strategic Business and Operational Plans by November 30 to the Office of the Cabinet. 

4.	Strategic and Operational Plans are usually amended based on agreed budgetary allocations from the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service and approved by the relevant Ministers by March 30.

5.	Planning translates into implementation, and it is monitored by quarterly reports sent to the Office of the Cabinet.


### National budgeting process

1.	The Cabinet and the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service, determine budgetary ceilings by sector/ministry (usually before September 30).

2.	The MOFPS issues a circular or "Budget Call" documents to all MDAs (Financial Management Regulations), at the same time the Office of the Cabinet issues the "Planning Call".

3.	MDAs are required to submit Strategic Business and Operational Plans by November 30 to the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service (considering the Financial Administration and Audit Act and Financial Management Regulations). MDAs apply the MTRBB template to align the budget with expected results.

4.	Discussions/negotiations between the MOFPS and MDAs regarding budget needs, options, and objectives. 

5.	The finalised budget (Estimates of Expenditure) is submitted to Cabinet for approval and laid before the Parliament through the House of Representatives before the end of the Financial Year (usually March 30).

6.	Parliament debates the budget and approves allocation usually by the end of April (the beginning of the new financial year). The budget is supported and allocated based on the priorities of the Government.
