# Definitions and concepts {-}

**Evaluation** - The systematic and objective assessment of an ongoing or completed project, programme, or policy, including its design, implementation, and results.

**Monitoring** â€“ The continuous and systematic collection of data on specified indicators, to provide information on the extent to which resources have been used and what outputs have been achieved or produced. 

**Result** - Clearly defined and demonstrable output, outcome, or impact (intended or unintended, positive and/or negative) of an intervention.

**Results-Based Management System (RBM System)**^[This concept was developed following internationally recognised standards and approaches and contextualised to the particular case of CARICOM]  - It is a global and systemic approach to management that orients all strategies, actions, and resources (both human and material) towards improving decision-making and the achievement and measurement of clearly defined and demonstrable results expected by governments and institutions, whether national, regional, or global. 

This systemic approach can be analysed at three levels (considering all the relationships that may exist between them) for CARICOM: the national level, the regional institutions level, and the whole-regional / CARICOM level. These levels are individual and do not have a defined hierarchy, as they have their own institutional, human, financial and multidimensional contextual characteristics that make them independent of each other. Nevertheless, the articulation between them is relevant to understanding how RBM operates in the region.

The RBM system can, in turn, be composed of different sub-systems (that are systems by themselves). Some of the most important, but not the only ones, are: the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) sub-system (with the formal document that institutionalises it: the M&E Policy or Framework, if it exists); the data and information sub-system, which generates, processes, systematises and publishes relevant information to know and scale the multidimensional situation of the country or institution and thus identify problems to be addressed and guide decision-making; the human resources management sub-system, which builds and constantly strengthens the necessary capacities to have the staff with the capabilities to carry out the M&E and RBM activities necessary to achieve and measure the expected results, etc.


RBM policies, on the other hand, are key elements of a sustainable RBM system but are not, by themselves, the system. RBM policies are the normative framework that: defines how the RBM system will be structured; establishes the guiding principles for the results-oriented approach; communicates what RBM entails for the country, institution or region; identifies stakeholders to be involved and their responsibilities; and identifies the needs to execute the necessary activities, among other elements. National, institutional, and regional RBM systems linkages may be established in RBM policies, which may have shared elements.


In this way, we should not confuse the RBM system with technological applications, platforms, software, or digital repositories with data or information contained and systematised, with the other sub-systems (described above) that conforms it, or with the RBM policies; but we should assume that to have a fully operational RBM system, it is necessary to seek a good articulation between all the sub-systems and levels, so we can achieve and measure the expected results, both at the national and regional levels.
