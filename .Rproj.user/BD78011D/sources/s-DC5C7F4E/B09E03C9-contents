# Next steps to building the roadmap  {#section6}

RBM entails more than compliance to specific requirements. Compliance is just not enough; it has to do with a change of mindset on the way things are done. This change of mindset involves different areas and stages of the administration. Having reviewed the main results from the Preparedness Diagnostic in terms of the dimensions of elements considered as part of an ideal RBM system, this section introduces the next steps that will be carried out as part of the process of building contextualized roadmaps. 

The roadmap will present pathways to influence planning, budgeting, implementation, and the M&E functions, as well as accountability and learning promotion. The main objective is for Jamaica to have a defined action course that also specifies responsibilities and shows the importance of the participation of all relevant stakeholders.

The whole process has a coproduction approach, were aside of the CLEAR LAC team, the CARICOM Secretariat, and the Executive Coordinators, key stakeholders will be involved in a fluid process to develop a learning loop for  feedback and process improvement.

This report is considered as the _starting point_ in this process; take into consideration that, as [figure 7](#fig:figure7) illustrates, the process started before its publication. 

Once the first draft was completed, it will be shared with key stakeholders for review and validation, starting with the Executive Coordinators. Once the feedback period concluded, the report itself became an input for what is to come and will be distributed with multiple purposes (including generating knowledge, aiding in empowering key stakeholders in the path of strengthening RBM practices, and promoting appropriation of the next steps). 

The next steps start with _defining the road_, engaging key stakeholders to coproduce contextualized mid-term roadmaps that will include specific activities and milestones that sought to materialize their implementation. To develop the roadmap, the CLEAR LAC team has designed a series of workshops with the participation of stakeholders involved in the different areas and levels of what is to be the national RBM system, and that have been carefully identified as part of the Preparedness Diagnostic process. 

To _move forward_, this first draft of the roadmap is presented to other relevant stakeholders to build a consensus and support for the process. It is crucial to gain whole-of-government ownership, so it is important to define and implement a dissemination strategy for _sharing clearly define milestones_ in different levels: internal, external, and regional once they have been clearly defined and responsibilities have been assigned. Finally, it is important to _track the progress_ of implementation and communicate results to assure that the Member State learns from the process, adjusts, and stays on the recommended path, as well as communicating results. The continuum process of identifying, sharing, reviewing, and adjusting represents a learning loop.

## Stakeholders’ contribution analysis

This section presents an analysis of stakeholders to identify which of them are relevant to strengthening the RBM system, identifying the main actors that should be involved in the process. Each of these stakeholders are involved in the decision making and execution at varied levels. Based on the CLEAR LAC’s team analysis, a proposal of the possible contribution of the stakeholders (considering positions and experience) is summarised below to support the improvement of the system which will generate the necessary evidence and results for decision-making regarding planning, budgeting and thus achieve the expected results of the GoJ is presented here based on the CLEAR LAC’s team analysis considering their positions and experience. 

The analysis is summarized in the following table (the list of stakeholders that could take part of the RBM systems is not limited to those presented in Table 3; due to the continuous changes in dynamics within governments and other contextual factors, additional stakeholders may become relevant). During the roadmap development workshops that will be held with government stakeholders, new stakeholders could be identified or some of those presented here could be discarded. For the special case of Jamaica, it is important to recognize that, once its RBM Policy is approved and published, we will be able to have greater clarity on the roles, responsibilities, capacities, and relevance of the stakeholders that will integrate the system both at MDA and whole-of-government approach.
