# Definitions and concepts {-}

**Evaluation** - The systematic and objective assessment of an ongoing or completed project, programme, or policy, including its design, implementation, and results.

**Monitoring** – The continuous and systematic collection of data on specified indicators, to provide information on the extent to which resources have been used and what outputs have been achieved or produced. 

**Result** - Clearly defined and demonstrable output, outcome, or impact (intended or unintended, positive and/or negative) of an intervention.

**Results-Based Management System (RBM System)**^[This concept was developed following internationally recognised standards and approaches and contextualised to the particular case of CARICOM]  - It is a global and systemic approach to management that orients all strategies, actions, and resources (both human and material) towards improving decision-making and the achievement and measurement of clearly defined and demonstrable results expected by governments and institutions, whether national, regional, or global. 

This systemic approach can be analysed at three levels (considering all the relationships that may exist between them) for CARICOM: the national level, the regional institutions level, and the whole-regional / CARICOM level. These levels are individual and do not have a defined hierarchy, as they have their own institutional, human, financial and multidimensional contextual characteristics that make them independent of each other. Nevertheless, the articulation between them is relevant to understanding how RBM operates in the region.

The RBM system can, in turn, be composed of different sub-systems (that are systems by themselves). Some of the most important, but not the only ones, are: the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) sub-system (with the formal document that institutionalises it: the M&E Policy or Framework, if it exists); the data and information sub-system, which generates, processes, systematises and publishes relevant information to know and scale the multidimensional situation of the country or institution and thus identify problems to be addressed and guide decision-making; the human resources management sub-system, which builds and constantly strengthens the necessary capacities to have the staff with the capabilities to carry out the M&E and RBM activities necessary to achieve and measure the expected results, etc.


RBM policies, on the other hand, are key elements of a sustainable RBM system but are not, by themselves, the system. RBM policies are the normative framework that: defines how the RBM system will be structured; establishes the guiding principles for the results-oriented approach; communicates what RBM entails for the country, institution or region; identifies stakeholders to be involved and their responsibilities; and identifies the needs to execute the necessary activities, among other elements. National, institutional, and regional RBM systems linkages may be established in RBM policies, which may have shared elements.


In this way, we should not confuse the RBM system with technological applications, platforms, software, or digital repositories with data or information contained and systematised, with the other sub-systems (described above) that conforms it, or with the RBM policies; but we should assume that to have a fully operational RBM system, it is necessary to seek a good articulation between all the sub-systems and levels, so we can achieve and measure the expected results, both at the national and regional levels.

# (PART) Preparedness Diagnosis {-}

# Introduction

In July 2014, the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), approved the CARICOM Strategic Plan 2015-2019 which articulated the need for a more results-focused approach to programme and project management, and committed the Caribbean Community Secretariat to establish a planning, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and reporting system based on the principles of Results-Based Management (RBM). In executing the tenets of the Community Strategic Plan, all implementing partners have expressed concern about an _implementation deficit_. This has resulted in poor implementation of public policy and Regional Public Goods in many Member States, culminating in low rates of successful program and project implementation across the Community.

Efforts to address the _implementation deficit_, to promote a more results-focused approach to programme and project management, and to strengthen RBM in the Community commenced in 2016 with the engagement of the consulting firm Baastel, to develop the CARICOM RBM System and support its institutionalisation at the CARICOM Secretariat. In October 2019, the CARICOM Secretariat requested technical assistance^[With non-lending Technical Assistance (TA) the Bank helps clients to implement reform and/or strengthen institutions. Qualified TA activity must meet the following criteria: have a primary intent of enabling an external client to implement reform and/or strengthen institutions; be linked to a Bank unit with clear accountability for the service provided.]  from the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) to continue these efforts by supporting CARICOM in strengthening a result-oriented culture across the Community, which includes three implementing partners, the Member States, Regional Institutions, and the CARICOM Secretariat.

As part of the collaboration, the IEG and CLEAR LAC under the Global Evaluation Initiative (GEI) agreed to provide technical assistance in the establishment and institutionalisation of RBM policies, in addition to the Secretariat, to three pilot Member States (Dominica, Jamaica, and Saint Lucia) and three pilot Regional Institutions (the Caribbean Development Fund, the Caribbean Examinations Council, and the CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and Security). These pilots will serve as champions to support capacity strengthening in the remaining Member States and Regional Institutions, in collaboration with IEG and the CARICOM Secretariat.

In order to establish a customize roadmap to strengthen the pilot´s RBM Systems, a Preparedness Diagnostic was identified as a first step of the collaboration to assess the level of maturity of the systems and identify specific contextual and organizational features and milestones to be achieved over a over a five-year period.

This report presents the findings from the Preparedness Diagnostic for Jamaica. The report provides information on the existing strengthens and opportunities to develop a sustainable RBM System in the Member State.

The report consists of six sections, including the introduction. [Section 2](#section2) 2 presents the methodology (including the Theory of Change of this activity); the Preparedness Diagnostic stages; and the “Ideal RBM System,” which consists of a four-dimension benchmark for this assessment). [Section 3](#section3) contains general and contextual information about Jamaica. This section also addresses the interest, expectations and challenges that may arise through the implementation of an RBM system using a whole of government approach. Additionally progress on the development of their RBM system based on the four dimensions is presented under this section.

[Section 4](#section4) presents the main findings highlighting the level of progress for Jamaica in each of the four dimensions, and a stakeholder’s analysis. Finally, Section 5 introduces the process for building a contextualized roadmap for advancing a sustainable RBM system for Jamaica.

[Section 5](#section5) presents the main findings and level of progress for Dominica in each of the four dimensions. Finally, [Section 6](#section6) introduces the process for building a contextualized roadmap for advancing towards a sustainable RBM system for Dominica, as well as a stakeholders’ contribution analysis.

After reading this report, the reader will obtain a clear idea of the existing practices and elements to strength on and advance  towards achieving a sustainable RBM system based on key elements. The report may also be used to guide discussions among relevant stakeholders to support sensitization of key stakeholders in the area of  RBM practices; to share best practices with other Member States; as well as to promote existing promising  practices that are being implemented.

Specifically, within the framework of this collaboration, the report represents the main input for the development of the contextualized medium-term roadmaps which will be facilitated  through participatory workshops and engagements.
