## Key dimensions of a sustainable RBM System

The development of an RBM System is a complex and nonlinear process that must be contextualized to the specific region, country, or regional institution. However, the multiple efforts done over time allow us to learn from experiences in different settings and identify good practices. These good practices represent useful inputs to be considered when embarked on this road. 


One significant component to strengthen RBM in the Community is to build, in a participatory process, specific roadmaps to continue the development of RBM Systems for each pilot member state and regional institution. The member states and regional institutions participating in the pilot have significant but heterogeneous advances achieving this goal. To identify these advances and guide the analysis of the Preparedness Diagnostic stages, the CLEAR LAC team defined four dimensions of an ideal and sustainable RBM System:


-	_Institutionalisation:_ this dimension focuses on the formal rules that defines, outlines and formalize the RBM Systems in the countries.

-	_Execution framework:_ this dimension focuses on the systems, resources, processes, methodologies, and tools necessary for the implementation of the RBM system, as well as incentives that promote an enabling environment.

-	_Technical capabilities:_ this dimension focuses on the capacities, abilities, and resources necessary to implement and sustain the RBM System.

-	_Use of evidence:_ this dimension focuses on the dissemination strategies and incentives aimed at stakeholders with the purpose that they use the evidence generated by the RBM System and its measurement.

##	Ideal elements & sub-elements

The four dimensions previously mentioned were conceptualized as necessary components when building an operating and sustainable RBM system. To have a better understanding of what the progress in each dimension entails, we propose a set of ideal elements and sub-elements taken from different contexts and experiences where they have been successfully implemented or recommended. Each dimension has a set of elements that represent activities, documents, normative frameworks, skills, incentives, etc.; and every element has a set of sub-elements that describe the ideal characteristics of the element. The sub-elements allow to translate concepts into practice, and, after gathering and analysing information, this knowledge can be translated into specific actions.

Unlike the dimensions, as RBM Systems are designed and built considering contextual factors, some elements and sub-elements should be taken as a guide as different contexts will result in variations on their interpretation and level of relevance/priorities. This framework allows for adaptations, recognizing that every context is particular and that there is no unique checklist that may apply to all contexts.

##	Levels of progress

The Preparedness Diagnostic methodology is designed to gain a deep understanding of a country or institution’s relevant aspects/characteristics when developing an RBM System. The different stages are meant to gather information from different stakeholders to achieve a whole of government / institutional outlook. The dimensions with ideal elements and sub-elements guide the analysis of the information gathered in order to identify the level of progress of a specific government or institution.

The scale used to assess the sub-elements are:

-	No: there is no documented advance in the sub-element
-	Needs improvement: there is documented advance in the sub-element, but do not cover all the criteria express in the sub-element.
-	Yes: there is documented proof that the sub-element complies with the needed/ideal characteristics

Each scale level has an assigned value, and every element will have a result obtained from the total sum of its sub-element’s scores. The average score of the elements per dimension results in the dimension’s score, and the average score of the four dimensions will place the Member state/regional Institution in one of the following **levels of progress** of their RBM Systems:

-	Level 0. No RBM
-	Level 1. Early initiatives: there are some initiatives to develop RBM-related structures and focus on monitoring activities
-	Level 2. Committed development: there are RBM-related structures being stablished and limited evaluation activities
-	Level 3.. Growing RBM system: there are RBM-related structures being stablished and limited evaluation activities
-	Level 4. Consolidated practices: there are integrated efforts (political will, capacity building and some whole-of-government consensus) to develop the RBM System
-	Level 5. Mature state: Functioning and sustainable RBM System in place that generates credible, reliable and timely information that improves public policies
