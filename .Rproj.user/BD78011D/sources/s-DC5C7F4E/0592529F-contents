## National planning process

Jamaica's planning process is consistent over time and identifies the times, resources, and personnel necessary to carry it out. The process can be synthesized as follows:

1.	The Cabinet determines the priorities of the Government for the short and medium terms based on the National Development Plan Vision 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the Government´s political objects (usually before September 30). 

2.	The Office of the Cabinet at the same time issues a circular of "Planning Call" (Performance Management Operating Policy and Procedures) document for the Four-Year Strategic Business and Operational Plans that are aligned to the budget and priorities of the Government.

3.	MDAs are required to submit Strategic Business and Operational Plans by November 30 to the Office of the Cabinet.

4.	Strategic and Operational Plans are usually amended based on agreed budgetary allocations from the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service and approved by the relevant Ministers by March 30. Additional amendments can be made based on the Office of the Cabinet’s Strategic Business and Operational Plan reviews.

5.	Planning translates into implementation, and it is monitored by quarterly reports sent to the Office of the Cabinet. Technical feedback (general alignment, quality, consistency etc.) is provided by the Office of the Cabinet on the plans and reports submitted.


## National budgeting process


1.	The Cabinet and the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service, determine budgetary ceilings by sector/ministry (usually before September 30).

2.	The MOFPS issues a circular or "Budget Call" documents to all MDAs (Financial Management Regulations), at the same time the Office of the Cabinet issues the "Planning Call".

3.	MDAs are required to submit Strategic Business and Operational Plans by November 30 to the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service (considering the Financial Administration and Audit Act and Financial Management Regulations). MDAs apply the MTRBB template to align the budget with expected results.

4.	Discussions/negotiations between the MOFPS and MDAs regarding budget needs, options, and objectives. 

5.	The finalised budget (Estimates of Expenditure) is submitted to Cabinet for approval and laid before the Parliament through the House of Representatives before the end of the Financial Year (usually March 30). 

6.	Parliament debates the budget and approves allocation usually by the end of April (the beginning of the new financial year). The budget is supported and allocated based on the priorities of the Government.
