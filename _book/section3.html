<p>This section presents the methodology and approach of the preparedness diagnostic used under this collaboration to strengthen RBM in the Community. It also presents the strengths and limitations of the methodology that should be considered when analysing the results or future replication exercises.</p>
<div id="theory-of-change-of-a-sustainable-rbm-system" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="3.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Theory of Change of a sustainable RBM System<a href="section3.html#theory-of-change-of-a-sustainable-rbm-system" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The collaboration addresses an implementation deficit of public policies of CARICOM Member States that results in poor resolution of socio-economic problems which affects the well-being of the citizens..</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a summarized theory of change of the collaborations’ activity. As described in previous sections, this report is intended to communicate the findings of a thorough RBM preparedness diagnostic which was conducted with Jamaica. The four stages of the preparedness diagnostic provided relevant information that served as inputs for this report. In addition, it provided a contextual framework, to identify a network of champions to support the process. These additional gains will inform the next steps required to develop the Jamaican RBM roadmap</p>
<p>This final report is the main input for the participatory workshops, for which specific processes have been defined and are presented in <a href="section5.html#section5">section 5</a>.The workshops will lead to the development of a contextualized roadmap with activities and responsibilities to advance the implementation of a sustainable RBM system, aligned to the four dimensions: <em>Institutionalization, Operational Framework, Technical Capacity, and the Use of Evidence</em>. These dimensions are further described in the following subsection and <a href="appendixA.html#appendixA">Appendix A</a>.</p>
<p>The fulfilment and continuity of the activities integrating the roadmap, together with the continuous promotion and support of an enabling environment and a system of incentives with a whole of government/institution approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>expected to lead to the institutionalisation of the RBM system (understood as the existence, acknowledgement, and communication of clear rules);</p></li>
<li><p>to the development of technical elements to support the system (understood as having developed capacity for generating and using the evidence that feeds the system);</p></li>
<li><p>to having an organizational design and actual roll-out of the system (understood as having structures and processes designed and implemented for generating evidence and enabling the fulfilment of the normative framework);</p></li>
<li><p>and finally, to a communication and persuasion strategy (understood as having timely access to evidence and knowing the paths to promote and measure its use).</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>As these four dimensions advance and become solid practices, beyond compliance, the system moves towards an increase in evidence-based decision making across government/the institution and across planning, budgeting, and implementation that makes it possible to increase public policies’ efficiency, efficacy, and effectiveness.</p>
<p>As the system stays in place and becomes mature, all the dimensions will be strengthened, the enabling environment will advance towards an RBM culture, and all of these will end up contributing to improve the socio-economic well-being of the member state and its population.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Ideal RBM system and working process<a href="section3.html#ideal-rbm-system-and-working-process" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The development of an RBM System is a complex and nonlinear process that must be contextualized to the specific Member State. To establish a roadmap to strengthen or build an RBM system, the following three elements were considered:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A benchmark against which to assess the level of maturity dubbed as “Ideal RBM System”</li>
<li>A methodology to obtain general and specific recommendations and,</li>
<li>A working process and approach to generate ownership</li>
</ol>
<p>To establish the Ideal RBM system, multiple efforts done over time allow us to learn from experiences in different settings and identify good practices. These good practices represented useful inputs to determine ideal features of an RBM System. The CLEAR LAC team engaged in this collaboration defined four dimensions of an ideal sustainable RBM system (see <a href="section3.html#fig:figure2">Figure 2</a>):</p>
<hr />
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:figure2"></span>
<img src="images/figure_2.png" alt="Dimensions of an ideal RBM system" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3.2: Dimensions of an ideal RBM system
</p>
</div>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><p><em>Institutionalisation:</em> this dimension focuses on the formal rules that outline the RBM policy in the countries or regional institutions.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Execution framework:</em> this dimension focuses on the systems, resources, processes, methodologies, and tools necessary for the implementation of an RBM system, as well as on the enabling environment.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Technical capabilities:</em> this dimension focuses on the necessary capacities and abilities to implement an RBM System.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use of evidence:</em> this dimension focuses on the dissemination strategies and incentives aimed at stakeholders with the purpose that they use the evidence generated by the RBM System.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each dimension is integrated by key elements that constitute specific documents, normative frameworks, activities, incentives, among others. These different elements facilitate the operationalisation of the dimension as part of an RBM System. In a third level (beneath dimensions and elements), each element has sub-elements that list their ideal characteristics.</p>
<p>Once all the required information is gathered and analysed (based on the dimension-element-subelement structure) the dimensions will be assessed using a 3-level scale for each sub-element (no, yes, need of improvement)<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> .</p>
<p>For this last step, the progress rate in each sub-element within the element is added end and a cumulative value will be generated to rate the element. Subsequently, all the element values within each dimension are added to determine the progress rate of each dimension.</p>
<p>Finally, the average from the progress of the four dimensions will place each Member State at a specific level of progress (Early initiatives; Committed development; Growing RBM system; Consolidated practices, or Mature state) in the development and implementation of an RBM System (see <a href="appendixC.html#appendixC">Appendix C</a> for more details).</p>
<p>The working process, defined for this collaboration, identifies Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) activities as central elements to be developed and applied in order to affect planning, budgeting, and implementation. <a href="section3.html#fig:figure3">Figure 3</a> presents the working process and highlights the importance of evidence-based decision making (guided and made feasible by M&amp;E activities and supported, strengthened, and made sustainable through learning and accountability).</p>

<hr />
<p>One significant component to strengthen RBM in the Community is to build, in a participatory process, specific roadmaps to continue the development of RBM Systems for each pilot member state and regional institution. The member states and regional institutions participating in the pilot have relevant but heterogeneous advances achieving this goal. To identify these advances, guide the analysis of the Preparedness Diagnostic stages, and develop ownership, the roadmap will be defined in workshops with key stakeholders involved in different levels (management, coordination, and operation).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Stages of the Preparedness Diagnostic<a href="section3.html#stages-of-the-preparedness-diagnostic" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The Preparedness Diagnostic (PD) is a four-stage methodology designed to gain a deep understanding of the characteristics of the Member State to inform the development of an RBM System. One main assumption underpinning the methodological design of the PD, is that building a sustainable RBM System requires the active involvement of multiple stakeholders. The PD uses different data collection methods to identify and engage these stakeholders at different stages as well as to obtain information to understand the current policy environment; stakeholder’s interests, their roles, motivations, relationship dynamics; map existing institutional structures, practices, and mechanisms; and define capacity building needs.</p>
<p>To successfully execute the PD, the CLEAR LAC team, in collaboration with the CARICOM Secretariat, selected Executive Coordinators who are representatives for the collaboration from the three Member States (Dominica, Jamaica and Saint Lucia) and the three Regional Institutions (the CARICOM Development Fund, the Caribbean Examinations Council and the CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and Security). The role of the Executive Coordinators was key to execute the PD as they have an overall knowledge of their Member State or Regional Institution and have experience in RBM. As Executive Coordinators and key informants, they acted as focal points and contributed to identifying and engaging relevant stakeholders at the different stages of the PD.</p>
<div id="stages-of-the-pd" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Stages of the PD<a href="section3.html#stages-of-the-pd" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The four stages of the PD (presented in <a href="section3.html#fig:figure4">Figure 4</a> ) are implemented according to a specific sequence and were customized based on the findings of the previous stage. They also involve the participation of different stakeholders to obtain a broad perspective of the pilot Member States and Regional Institutions. The figure below provides a brief description of the approach for implementing the stages.</p>
<hr />
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:figure4"></span>

<hr />
<p>The <strong>Opening stage</strong> consisted of a request for different documents from the Executive Coordinators, regarding the pilots’ planning, budgeting, and M&amp;E practices. The desk review and analysis of these documents, in addition to other publicly available information, allowed the design of targeted customized questions for each pilot in the next stage.</p>
<p>The <strong>Approach stage</strong> involved the identification of various key stakeholders with the support of the Executive Coordinators and the CARICOM Secretariat. The semi-structured interviews addressed general themes that allowed the team to develop rapport with relevant actors within the pilots, as well as obtain additional information about the pilots’ current policy environment.</p>
<p>The <strong>Diagnosis stage</strong> consisted of a series of online questionnaires for the Ministries, Agencies, and Departments of Member States, and Units of Regional Institutions. This stage aimed to gather more in-depth information which would complement information gathered in previous stages and to strengthen the whole of government approach for RBM. The participants were able to respond to questions and upload documents in a timeframe of approximately four weeks, as well as consult with other stakeholders for any additional information within their pilot Member States or Regional Institutions.</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>Filling-the-blanks</strong> was aimed at addressing information gaps from the previous stages through a series of structured interviews. This stage targeted other stakeholders such as members of Parliament, representatives of multilateral international organizations, development partners, etc.</p>
