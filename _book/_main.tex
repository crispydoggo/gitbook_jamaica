\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Definitions and concepts}

\textbf{Evaluation} - The systematic and objective assessment of an ongoing or completed project, programme, or policy, including its design, implementation, and results.

\textbf{Monitoring} -- The continuous and systematic collection of data on specified indicators, to provide information on the extent to which resources have been used and what outputs have been achieved or produced.

\textbf{Result} - Clearly defined and demonstrable output, outcome, or impact (intended or unintended, positive and/or negative) of an intervention.

\textbf{Results-Based Management System (RBM System)}\footnote{This concept was developed following internationally recognised standards and approaches and contextualised to the particular case of CARICOM} - It is a global and systemic approach to management that orients all strategies, actions, and resources (both human and material) towards improving decision-making and the achievement and measurement of clearly defined and demonstrable results expected by governments and institutions, whether national, regional, or global.

This systemic approach can be analysed at three levels (considering all the relationships that may exist between them) for CARICOM: the national level, the regional institutions level, and the whole-regional / CARICOM level. These levels are individual and do not have a defined hierarchy, as they have their own institutional, human, financial and multidimensional contextual characteristics that make them independent of each other. Nevertheless, the articulation between them is relevant to understanding how RBM operates in the region.

The RBM system can, in turn, be composed of different sub-systems (that are systems by themselves). Some of the most important, but not the only ones, are: the monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) sub-system (with the formal document that institutionalises it: the M\&E Policy or Framework, if it exists); the data and information sub-system, which generates, processes, systematises and publishes relevant information to know and scale the multidimensional situation of the country or institution and thus identify problems to be addressed and guide decision-making; the human resources management sub-system, which builds and constantly strengthens the necessary capacities to have the staff with the capabilities to carry out the M\&E and RBM activities necessary to achieve and measure the expected results, etc.

RBM policies, on the other hand, are key elements of a sustainable RBM system but are not, by themselves, the system. RBM policies are the normative framework that: defines how the RBM system will be structured; establishes the guiding principles for the results-oriented approach; communicates what RBM entails for the country, institution or region; identifies stakeholders to be involved and their responsibilities; and identifies the needs to execute the necessary activities, among other elements. National, institutional, and regional RBM systems linkages may be established in RBM policies, which may have shared elements.

In this way, we should not confuse the RBM system with technological applications, platforms, software, or digital repositories with data or information contained and systematised, with the other sub-systems (described above) that conforms it, or with the RBM policies; but we should assume that to have a fully operational RBM system, it is necessary to seek a good articulation between all the sub-systems and levels, so we can achieve and measure the expected results, both at the national and regional levels.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In July 2014, the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), approved the CARICOM Strategic Plan 2015-2019 which articulated the need for a more results-focused approach to programme and project management, and committed the Caribbean Community Secretariat to establish a planning, monitoring and evaluation (M\&E), and reporting system based on the principles of Results-Based Management (RBM). In executing the tenets of the Community Strategic Plan, all implementing partners have expressed concern about an \emph{implementation deficit}. This has resulted in poor implementation of public policy and Regional Public Goods in many Member States, culminating in low rates of successful program and project implementation across the Community.

Efforts to address the \emph{implementation deficit}, to promote a more results-focused approach to programme and project management, and to strengthen RBM in the Community commenced in 2016 with the engagement of the consulting firm Baastel, to develop the CARICOM RBM System and support its institutionalisation at the CARICOM Secretariat. In October 2019, the CARICOM Secretariat requested technical assistance\footnote{With non-lending Technical Assistance (TA) the Bank helps clients to implement reform and/or strengthen institutions. Qualified TA activity must meet the following criteria: have a primary intent of enabling an external client to implement reform and/or strengthen institutions; be linked to a Bank unit with clear accountability for the service provided.} from the World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) to continue these efforts by supporting CARICOM in strengthening a result-oriented culture across the Community, which includes three implementing partners, the Member States, Regional Institutions, and the CARICOM Secretariat.

As part of the collaboration, the IEG and CLEAR LAC under the Global Evaluation Initiative (GEI) agreed to provide technical assistance in the establishment and institutionalisation of RBM policies, in addition to the Secretariat, to three pilot Member States (Dominica, Jamaica, and Saint Lucia) and three pilot Regional Institutions (the Caribbean Development Fund, the Caribbean Examinations Council, and the CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and Security). These pilots will serve as champions to support capacity strengthening in the remaining Member States and Regional Institutions, in collaboration with IEG and the CARICOM Secretariat.

In order to establish a customize roadmap to strengthen the pilot´s RBM Systems, a Preparedness Diagnostic was identified as a first step of the collaboration to assess the level of maturity of the systems and identify specific contextual and organizational features and milestones to be achieved over a over a five-year period.

This report presents the findings from the Preparedness Diagnostic for Jamaica. The report provides information on the existing strengthens and opportunities to develop a sustainable RBM System in the Member State.

The report consists of six sections, including the introduction. \protect\hyperlink{section2}{Section 2} will present Jamaica'sposition on the results of the Preparedness Diagnostic. \protect\hyperlink{section3}{Section 3} presents the methodology (including the Theory of Change of this activity); the Preparedness Diagnostic stages; and the ``Ideal RBM System,'' which consists of a four-dimension benchmark for this assessment).

\protect\hyperlink{section4}{Section 4} contains general and contextual information about Jamaica. This section also addresses the interest, expectations and challenges that may arise through the implementation of an RBM system using a whole of government approach. Additionally progress on the development of their RBM system based on the four dimensions is presented under this section.

\protect\hyperlink{section5}{Section 5} presents the main findings highlighting the level of progress for Jamaica in each of the four dimensions, and a stakeholder's analysis. Finally, \protect\hyperlink{sectionux5cux26}{Section 6} introduces the process for building a contextualized roadmap for advancing a sustainable RBM system for Jamaica, as well as a stakeholders' contribution analysis.

After reading this report, the reader will obtain a clear idea of the existing practices and elements to strength on and advance towards achieving a sustainable RBM system based on key elements. The report may also be used to guide discussions among relevant stakeholders to support sensitization of key stakeholders in the area of RBM practices; to share best practices with other Member States; as well as to promote existing promising practices that are being implemented.

Specifically, within the framework of this collaboration, the report represents the main input for the development of the contextualized medium-term roadmaps which will be facilitated through participatory workshops and engagements.

\hypertarget{section2}{%
\chapter{Jamaica's position on the Preparedness Diagnostic}\label{section2}}

{ Once the final report has been finalised including the development of the roadmaps, this section will present a position from the Member State (coordinated by the Executive Coordinator for this collaboration) on the process of the preparedness diagnostic, the main findings identified, and the role of the CLEAR LAC team and the CARICOM Secretariat while developing it. }

\hypertarget{section3}{%
\chapter{Methodology}\label{section3}}

This section presents the methodology and approach of the preparedness diagnostic used under this collaboration to strengthen RBM in the Community. It also presents the strengths and limitations of the methodology that should be considered when analysing the results or future replication exercises.

\hypertarget{theory-of-change-of-a-sustainable-rbm-system}{%
\section{Theory of Change of a sustainable RBM System}\label{theory-of-change-of-a-sustainable-rbm-system}}

The collaboration addresses an implementation deficit of public policies of CARICOM Member States that results in poor resolution of socio-economic problems which affects the well-being of the citizens..

The diagram below shows a summarized theory of change of the collaborations' activity. As described in previous sections, this report is intended to communicate the findings of a thorough RBM preparedness diagnostic which was conducted with Jamaica. The four stages of the preparedness diagnostic provided relevant information that served as inputs for this report. In addition, it provided a contextual framework, to identify a network of champions to support the process. These additional gains will inform the next steps required to develop the Jamaican RBM roadmap

This final report is the main input for the participatory workshops, for which specific processes have been defined and are presented in \protect\hyperlink{section5}{section 5}.The workshops will lead to the development of a contextualized roadmap with activities and responsibilities to advance the implementation of a sustainable RBM system, aligned to the four dimensions: \emph{Institutionalization, Operational Framework, Technical Capacity, and the Use of Evidence}. These dimensions are further described in the following subsection and \protect\hyperlink{appendixA}{Appendix A}.

The fulfilment and continuity of the activities integrating the roadmap, together with the continuous promotion and support of an enabling environment and a system of incentives with a whole of government/institution approach are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  expected to lead to the institutionalisation of the RBM system (understood as the existence, acknowledgement, and communication of clear rules);
\item
  to the development of technical elements to support the system (understood as having developed capacity for generating and using the evidence that feeds the system);
\item
  to having an organizational design and actual roll-out of the system (understood as having structures and processes designed and implemented for generating evidence and enabling the fulfilment of the normative framework);
\item
  and finally, to a communication and persuasion strategy (understood as having timely access to evidence and knowing the paths to promote and measure its use).
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

}

\caption{Theory of Change}\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

As these four dimensions advance and become solid practices, beyond compliance, the system moves towards an increase in evidence-based decision making across government/the institution and across planning, budgeting, and implementation that makes it possible to increase public policies' efficiency, efficacy, and effectiveness.

As the system stays in place and becomes mature, all the dimensions will be strengthened, the enabling environment will advance towards an RBM culture, and all of these will end up contributing to improve the socio-economic well-being of the member state and its population.

\hypertarget{ideal-rbm-system-and-working-process}{%
\section{Ideal RBM system and working process}\label{ideal-rbm-system-and-working-process}}

The development of an RBM System is a complex and nonlinear process that must be contextualized to the specific Member State. To establish a roadmap to strengthen or build an RBM system, the following three elements were considered:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A benchmark against which to assess the level of maturity dubbed as ``Ideal RBM System''
\item
  A methodology to obtain general and specific recommendations and,
\item
  A working process and approach to generate ownership
\end{enumerate}

To establish the Ideal RBM system, multiple efforts done over time allow us to learn from experiences in different settings and identify good practices. These good practices represented useful inputs to determine ideal features of an RBM System. The CLEAR LAC team engaged in this collaboration defined four dimensions of an ideal sustainable RBM system (see \protect\hyperlink{fig:figure2}{Figure 2}):

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./images/figure_2} 

}

\caption{Dimensions of an ideal RBM system}\label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Institutionalisation:} this dimension focuses on the formal rules that outline the RBM policy in the countries or regional institutions.
\item
  \emph{Execution framework:} this dimension focuses on the systems, resources, processes, methodologies, and tools necessary for the implementation of an RBM system, as well as on the enabling environment.
\item
  \emph{Technical capabilities:} this dimension focuses on the necessary capacities and abilities to implement an RBM System.
\item
  \emph{Use of evidence:} this dimension focuses on the dissemination strategies and incentives aimed at stakeholders with the purpose that they use the evidence generated by the RBM System.
\end{itemize}

Each dimension is integrated by key elements that constitute specific documents, normative frameworks, activities, incentives, among others. These different elements facilitate the operationalisation of the dimension as part of an RBM System. In a third level (beneath dimensions and elements), each element has sub-elements that list their ideal characteristics.

Once all the required information is gathered and analysed (based on the dimension-element-subelement structure) the dimensions will be assessed using a 3-level scale for each sub-element (no, yes, need of improvement)\footnote{For more details on the 3-level scale see \protect\hyperlink{appendixC}{appendix C}} .

For this last step, the progress rate in each sub-element within the element is added end and a cumulative value will be generated to rate the element. Subsequently, all the element values within each dimension are added to determine the progress rate of each dimension.

Finally, the average from the progress of the four dimensions will place each Member State at a specific level of progress (Early initiatives; Committed development; Growing RBM system; Consolidated practices, or Mature state) in the development and implementation of an RBM System (see \protect\hyperlink{appendixC}{Appendix C} for more details).

The working process, defined for this collaboration, identifies Monitoring and Evaluation (M\&E) activities as central elements to be developed and applied in order to affect planning, budgeting, and implementation. \protect\hyperlink{fig:figure3}{Figure 3} presents the working process and highlights the importance of evidence-based decision making (guided and made feasible by M\&E activities and supported, strengthened, and made sustainable through learning and accountability).

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

One significant component to strengthen RBM in the Community is to build, in a participatory process, specific roadmaps to continue the development of RBM Systems for each pilot member state and regional institution. The member states and regional institutions participating in the pilot have relevant but heterogeneous advances achieving this goal. To identify these advances, guide the analysis of the Preparedness Diagnostic stages, and develop ownership, the roadmap will be defined in workshops with key stakeholders involved in different levels (management, coordination, and operation).

\hypertarget{stages-of-the-preparedness-diagnostic}{%
\section{Stages of the Preparedness Diagnostic}\label{stages-of-the-preparedness-diagnostic}}

The Preparedness Diagnostic (PD) is a four-stage methodology designed to gain a deep understanding of the characteristics of the Member State to inform the development of an RBM System. One main assumption underpinning the methodological design of the PD, is that building a sustainable RBM System requires the active involvement of multiple stakeholders. The PD uses different data collection methods to identify and engage these stakeholders at different stages as well as to obtain information to understand the current policy environment; stakeholder's interests, their roles, motivations, relationship dynamics; map existing institutional structures, practices, and mechanisms; and define capacity building needs.

To successfully execute the PD, the CLEAR LAC team, in collaboration with the CARICOM Secretariat, selected Executive Coordinators who are representatives for the collaboration from the three Member States (Dominica, Jamaica and Saint Lucia) and the three Regional Institutions (the CARICOM Development Fund, the Caribbean Examinations Council and the CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and Security). The role of the Executive Coordinators was key to execute the PD as they have an overall knowledge of their Member State or Regional Institution and have experience in RBM. As Executive Coordinators and key informants, they acted as focal points and contributed to identifying and engaging relevant stakeholders at the different stages of the PD.

\hypertarget{stages-of-the-pd}{%
\subsection*{Stages of the PD}\label{stages-of-the-pd}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Stages of the PD}

The four stages of the PD (presented in \protect\hyperlink{fig:figure4}{Figure 4} ) are implemented according to a specific sequence and were customized based on the findings of the previous stage. They also involve the participation of different stakeholders to obtain a broad perspective of the pilot Member States and Regional Institutions. The figure below provides a brief description of the approach for implementing the stages.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{Stages of the Preparedness Diagnostic}\label{fig:figure4}
\end{figure}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

The \textbf{Opening stage} consisted of a request for different documents from the Executive Coordinators, regarding the pilots' planning, budgeting, and M\&E practices. The desk review and analysis of these documents, in addition to other publicly available information, allowed the design of targeted customized questions for each pilot in the next stage.

The \textbf{Approach stage} involved the identification of various key stakeholders with the support of the Executive Coordinators and the CARICOM Secretariat. The semi-structured interviews addressed general themes that allowed the team to develop rapport with relevant actors within the pilots, as well as obtain additional information about the pilots' current policy environment.

The \textbf{Diagnosis stage} consisted of a series of online questionnaires for the Ministries, Agencies, and Departments of Member States, and Units of Regional Institutions. This stage aimed to gather more in-depth information which would complement information gathered in previous stages and to strengthen the whole of government approach for RBM. The participants were able to respond to questions and upload documents in a timeframe of approximately four weeks, as well as consult with other stakeholders for any additional information within their pilot Member States or Regional Institutions.

Finally, the \textbf{Filling-the-blanks} was aimed at addressing information gaps from the previous stages through a series of structured interviews. This stage targeted other stakeholders such as members of Parliament, representatives of multilateral international organizations, development partners, etc.

\item
  There are time limitations due to tight agendas of stakeholders that complicates reaching all the desired informants.
\item
  All stages were implemented remotely, and it is preferred to have some face-to-face contact with the stakeholders in at least one of the stages to generate rapport
\item
  The duration of the PD is approximately six effective months; however this was extended due to the whole of government/institution approach and the stakeholders' agendas.

\chapter{Jamaica's profile}\label{section4}}

Jamaica is the third largest island of the Caribbean islands, and the largest English-speaking Island in the Caribbean Sea, as well as one of the most populated ones with 2.961 million people. The country was a Spanish settlement from 1494 to 1655, when it was occupied by the English and was a British colony from 1707 to 1962. Under the English domain, the island became the primary exporter of sugar. In 1962, Jamaica declared its independence, however it remained a member of the Commonwealth, making the country a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government.

As a constitutional monarchy, the Executive power is vested in three figures: the head of State, a governor-general and a prime minister. The head of State is represented by the British monarch, currently exercised by Queen Elizabeth II. The governor-general is appointed by the monarch and has mostly ceremonial power and acts as a representative; Sir Patrick L. Allen has occupied this position since 2006. And finally, the head of the government is the prime minister, who is appointed by the leading political party from its parliamentary members- The constitution stipulates a five year-term for the Senate and the House of Representatives, this term applies to the selection of the prime minister. The prime minister position has been occupied by Andrew Holness, leader of the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP), since 2016.

The legislative branch is divided in two chambers: the House of Representatives, composed of 63 members, elected through universal vote for a five-year term; and the Senate, which has a total of 21 members appointed by the governor general, 13 on the advice of the prime minister, and 8 on the advice of the opposition leader. Two-thirds of both chambers is needed for major constitutional amendments.

Since its independence, Jamaica has alternated between the two major political parties, the social-democratic People's National Party (PNP) and the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP), however, each instance of change has been followed by a minimum of two successive periods in which the majority party stays in office. This has signified somewhat political stability for Jamaica since most cabinet ministers and other government officials stay in office for longer periods of time than their counterparts in other Latin-American countries.

In 2020, the Prime Minister called for early elections with the purpose of ensuring a united response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The JLP got the majority, receiving 57\% of the votes and winning 49 seats. The PNP remained the opposition party, losing 16 seats. Besides the obvious economic and health challenges derived from the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the biggest challenges the government has faced in late years have been the high rate of youth unemployment, poverty and crime and violence levels.

Regarding the foreign policy of the country, Jamaica is active in multilateral forums, such as the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS), as well as being member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Association of Caribbean States; both memberships have allowed the country to strengthen its ties with other Caribbean countries as well as facilitated economic and diplomatic cooperation.

Jamaica is also an important promoter at the international level for status' review of small countries whose condition as middle-income countries prevents their access to funds under preferential conditions and aims for international institutions to take into consideration the particular characteristics and vulnerabilities that insular countries face and are exposed to\footnote{BBC News.

\section{Jamaica's RBM profile}\label{jamaicas-rbm-profile}}

Jamaica is considered the RBM Champion in the Caribbean region. The country has made many efforts that have served as a guide for the rest of the countries, and it is considered a leader in this matter. According to the Preparedness Diagnostic results, Jamaica seeks to have a fully functional RBM system in place to strengthen the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) accountability, to incorporate better and more recurrent evidence in the processes of decision making regarding planning, budgeting and implementation in order to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  improve performance;
\item
  measure the results and impacts of policies and programmes;
\item
  each MDA to become the leader in their respective sector of action (e.g.~health, telecommunications, energy, etc.) and work vis-à-vis the private sector; and
\item
  reduce duplication of actions and waste of resources (financial and human).
\end{enumerate}

There have been great steps in creating and strengthening Jamaica's RBM system. For example from the institutional side, branches/units and other institutions were created within the government to formalize the planning and execution of the RBM system, as is the case of the Performance Management and Evaluation Branch. From the regulatory side, since 2005, frameworks and regulatory documents have been developed, modified and strengthened to improve the planning and budgeting of MDAs, such as the case of the Medium-Term Results-Based Budgeting (MTRBB) Framework, that seeks to align budget to the planning and results (both intended and achieved), the Public Investment Management System (PIMS), intended to strengthen Public Investment Management through the development of a unified set of procedures, guidelines and requirements established to govern all public investments, the Strategic Business Plans that seek guide the actions of the MDAs towards the achievement of the goals established in the National Development Plan (Vision 2030), the Employee Performance Management System and Policy (EPMS \& EPMP), the Performance Management and Appraisal System (PMAS), the Performance Management Evaluation Framework (PMEF) and the Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System (PMES, the main tool for RBM within MDAs), among many other. The GoJ has also reached out to international organisations, as well as to other countries, to seek support and to exchange best practices regarding M\&E and RBM.

Despite the GoJ's efforts mentioned above regarding planning, budgeting, and performance management, there seem to be significant deficiencies in articulating them to better implement, evaluate, and improve GoJ´s policies, programmes, and projects. Regarding implementation, the GoJ Jamaica, as well as CARICOM, are associated with a deficit in terms of policies, programs, projects, and processes (planning, budgeting, adjustments, etc.). This deficit can be seen through the progress rates of the implementation of programs, which are usually around 60\% , and whose terms of reference, plans and timeframes are often postponed, generating losses of resources and a lack of confidence of investors and donors in government. In addition, the deficit translates into a sharp decrease in the government's capacity to meet the demands of citizens, as well as the public problems that most afflict the country. In turn, the government's accountability and effectiveness undermine its position vis-a-vis the private, external sectors, and international aid.

For these reasons, the GoJ has prioritized the development and strengthening of its RBM system, to use the evidence generated from the system to improve decision-making and at the same time improve planning, budgeting, and the achievement of the results. In this sense, the Office of the Cabinet has been working on an RBM Policy that integrates all the efforts previously made and thus consolidates a comprehensive system that leverages the resources generated, now and in the future. According to this diagnosis, this RBM Policy will be comprehensive, coherent, exhaustive, and useful for the GoJ for identifying the main actions to be carried out to have a strong RBM system in place.

As mentioned before, having a whole-of-government RBM system in place and running will have effects on different processes, being planning and budgeting two of the most relevant ones. The GoJ has clearly defined planning and budgeting processes (see \protect\hyperlink{appendixC}{\textbf{Appendix C}}) that should be considered as the national RBM policy is developed; this will help identify specific needs and guide the RBM policy towards its use. The overall national planning and budgeting processes are briefly explained below:

\hypertarget{national-planning-process}{%
\subsection{National planning process}\label{national-planning-process}}

Jamaica's planning process is consistent over time and identifies the times, resources, and personnel necessary to carry it out. The process can be synthesized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The Cabinet determines the priorities of the Government for the short and medium terms based on the National Development Plan Vision 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the Government's political objectives (usually before September 30).
\item
  The Office of the Cabinet at the same time issues a circular of ``Planning Call'' (Performance Management Operating Policy and Procedures) document for the Four-Year Strategic Business and Operational Plans that are aligned to the budget and priorities of the Government.
\item
  MDAs are required to submit Strategic Business and Operational Plans by November 30 to the Office of the Cabinet.
\item
  Strategic and Operational Plans are usually amended based on agreed budgetary allocations from the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service and approved by the relevant Ministers by March 30.
\item
  Planning translates into implementation, and it is monitored by quarterly reports sent to the Office of the Cabinet.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{national-budgeting-process}{%
\subsection{National budgeting process}\label{national-budgeting-process}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The Cabinet and the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service, determine budgetary ceilings by sector/ministry (usually before September 30).
\item
  The MOFPS issues a circular or ``Budget Call'' documents to all MDAs (Financial Management Regulations), at the same time the Office of the Cabinet issues the ``Planning Call''.
\item
  MDAs are required to submit Strategic Business and Operational Plans by November 30 to the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service (considering the Financial Administration and Audit Act and Financial Management Regulations). MDAs apply the MTRBB template to align the budget with expected results.
\item
  Discussions/negotiations between the MOFPS and MDAs regarding budget needs, options, and objectives.
\item
  The finalised budget (Estimates of Expenditure) is submitted to Cabinet for approval and laid before the Parliament through the House of Representatives before the end of the Financial Year (usually March 30).
\item
  Parliament debates the budget and approves allocation usually by the end of April (the beginning of the new financial year). The budget is supported and allocated based on the priorities of the Government.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Main findings}\label{section5}}

As mentioned above, this Preparedness Diagnostic uses as a reference a four dimensions/bundles analysis, each one contains elements considered relevant to have an ``Ideal RBM System''. This Ideal RBM System serves as a benchmark that allow to compare the current situation in Jamaica in relation to the best possible scenario regarding practices, uses, and results of RBM. In this way, figure 5 shows the rate of progress that Jamaica has in each of the dimensions of analysis, with respect to the ideal scenario.

The elements and sub-elements of the reference Ideal RBM System are not usually part of the status quo, they should be identified, designed and developed; following this, a country that has not considered adopting RBM practices would probably not comply or show advances in any of the analysed elements. In this sense, all the advances identified in this diagnosis represent valuable progress.

It is important to mention that, although there is a numerical value for each dimension, behind the numbers there was a qualitative analysis that determined the current situation of Jamaica regarding RBM. Furthermore, these ``ratings'' are in terms of the ideal scenario, so in no way does it represent an outright success or failure, but rather approximation to the best possible situation of the RBM.

\caption{Level of progress of the Ideal RBM System}\label{fig:figure5}
\end{figure}

Considering this rate of progress, a metric was built to progressively identify five levels of maturity of RBM systems. In this way, the data presented above are averaged and a graph is generated for all the dimensions and a graph that contains the average of the dimensions, identifying the level in which the country falls . The 5 levels are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Early initiatives
\item
  Committed development
\item
  RBM System
\item
  Consolidated practices
\item
  Mature State
\end{enumerate}

For the case of Jamaica, the findings regarding the level of maturity of its RBM system are the following:

Jamaica is currently at the Committed development level. This occurs because even though the country has various RBM tools and activities in place, they are not articulated and regulated with a whole-of-government approach and incorporated in the planning and budgeting processes, Undoubtedly, one of the great efforts intended to correct this is the drafting of its RBM Policy, in which all government efforts will be articulated to strengthen the RBM system and obtain the expected results. However, as this Policy is not published yet, we cannot incorporate it into this diagnosis.

\hypertarget{results-by-dimension}{%
\section{Results by dimension}\label{results-by-dimension}}

The results of this diagnosis for each of the dimensions analysed (and their ideal elements) are presented below in a synthetic manner.

\hypertarget{institutionalisation}{%
\subsection{Institutionalisation}\label{institutionalisation}}

\textbf{Key Message:}
Jamaica has regulations/frameworks to define its RBM system, identifying the relevant actors that coordinate and implement it (e.g., PMEB, PIOJ, MOFPS Performance and Monitoring Branch). However, although there are regulations/frameworks and processes in place regarding RBM, these are not articulated, so there is no connection between the RBM system and the continuous improvement of planning and budgeting decision-making to be more results-oriented.

\textbf{1. There is a documented, approved and binding RBM Policy within the government} & Jamaica has had a long process of drafting its whole-of-government RBM Policy, and this process has incorporated inputs from different relevant stakeholders (both internal and external). In the first semester of 2022 the draft of the policy is being finalised, to be approved by the Cabinet by the end of the year.\\

\textbf{2. There are laws/regulations/norms recognizing M\&E activities across the government} & Although there are M\&E activities in some MDAs, there are no laws/regulations/norms recognizing them across all the government.\\
\hline
\textbf{3. There are guidelines that establish the rules and processes to perform monitoring activities} & The PIOJ oversees monitoring and evaluating the Medium-Term Socio-Economic Framework. For doing so, there are Technical Monitoring Committees (TMC) and thematic working groups (consultative bodies to improve planning, implementation, and monitoring). These are the only efforts to formally recognize policy monitoring in Jamaica. Though there are no guidelines regarding monitoring, there are monitoring activities across government in terms of budget and expenditure, however, in terms of the national plan and social policy, Jamaica does not have a mature set of indicators. Nevertheless, the ministries do the planning in accordance with the PMES framework.\\
\hline
\textbf{4. There are guidelines that establish the rules and processes to perform evaluation activities} & There is not a specific governing body or agency in Jamaica responsible for assisting/leading the evaluation function. However, there are some micro-projects evaluating practices within the government.\\
\hline
\textbf{5. There are guidelines that establish the rules and processes to address and use M\&E results} & Even though there are no guidelines to address and use M\&E results, budget monitoring and corporate planning are tools helping to allocate resources in priority programmes of the MDAs. However, there is no substantive use of information from M\&E to improve planning and budgeting.\\
\hline
\textbf{6. There are formal actions towards building an enabling environment} & Although there is a long way to go, Jamaica has been working on building an enabling environment for the institutionalisation, implementation, and use of an RBM system with Monitoring and Evaluation activities in its core. The GoJ has been creating incentives to use the findings of M\&E and the RBM system, such as the M\&E considerations and frameworks during the planning and budgeting processes of the MDAs (when elaborating Operational and Business Plans). However, they have not been sufficiently institutionalized to be able to obtain the expected results.\\
\hline
\textbf{7. There is a Results Oriented National Plan defined for a given period in the country} & Jamaica's National Development Plan is called Vision 2030 Jamaica and provides a comprehensive planning framework that integrates the economic, social, environmental, and governance aspects of national development. Vision 2030 is addressed in the Medium-Term Socio-Economic Policy Frameworks, which are the operationalisation of the national planning.\\

\textbf{Key Message:}
Jamaica has in the Office of the Cabinet the Performance Management and Evaluation Branch which acts as the coordinator of the RBM system and oversees the performance of the MDAs and harmonizing their Business Plans aligned with national objectives. The PMEB coordinates the development of a common language around M\&E and RBM, and it is recognized across government at all levels. However, to consolidate the M\&E system, it is necessary to guide and structure the processes and the management of human and financial resources to generate the evidence derived from M\&E activities that link MDAs' planning, budgeting, and implementation of their activities to achieve the desired results.

\textbf{Key Message:}
Although there are some efforts to strengthen RBM and M\&E capabilities within the GoJ, there is no sufficient offer (both private or public) or demand (from the government) for M\&E services and capacity building in RBM. Also, there are no sufficient skilled personnel within the government with the capability to identify M\&E needs and conduct M\&E activities to orientate planning and budgeting towards results.

Regarding training, the Management Institute for National Development (MIND) offers a diverse set of services on performance, and hard/soft skills needed in the public sector. The Strategic and Corporate and Planning course is one of the most relevant for Jamaica in terms of some M\&E components. There has also been some training in M\&E and RBM tools, however, training is focalized in the MOFPS, Ministry of Health and Wellness, the PIOJ and the Office of the Cabinet.

\section{Main challenges to strengthen the RBM system}\label{main-challenges-to-strengthen-the-rbm-system}}

As mentioned in \protect\hyperlink{section2}{section 2.2}, the development of an RBM System is a complex, nonlinear, and continuous process that must be contextualized in each country. In doing so, it is important to consider the main challenges that Dominica faces when it comes to strengthening its RBM system. This diagnosis identifies three major challenges:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Changing the culture and fostering the enabling environment to have an RBM system in place implies a change of mindset of public servants at all levels. It should be considered that throughout the process there must be a constant awareness/sensitization strategy, both in the short and medium term, that allows public servants to identify the importance to have this mindset change in pursuit of RBM. In other words, on a regular basis, there needs to be reminders on the importance of RBM and its impact on improving performance and lives of all citizens
\item
  Since this collaboration constitutes a whole-of-government approach, it is necessary to have a top-bottom commitment in which leaders and decision-makers demonstrate the benefits of the RBM system through evidence informed actions that are generated by the RBM system. This means that we need a top-bottom approach to use, and thereby demonstrate its usefulness, the information and evidence derived from the RBM system to improve planning and budgeting decisions.
\item
  For the RBM system to be sustainable, it is critical to generate a system of incentives and ensure that there is a balance between positive and negative incentives (such as potential penalties for non-compliance), to advance and sustain the system. The positive incentives can take different forms, from monetary to symbolic, such as the presentation of awards to staff and units and recognition for good performance in public service.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{section6}{%
\chapter{Next steps to building the roadmap}\label{section6}}

RBM entails more than compliance to specific requirements. Compliance is just not enough; it has to do with a change of mindset on the way things are done. This change of mindset involves different areas and stages of the administration. Having reviewed the main results from the Preparedness Diagnostic in terms of the dimensions of elements considered as part of an ideal RBM system, this section introduces the next steps that will be carried out as part of the process of building contextualized roadmaps.

The roadmap will present pathways to influence planning, budgeting, implementation, and the M\&E functions, as well as accountability and learning promotion. The main objective is for Jamaica to have a defined action course that also specifies responsibilities and shows the importance of the participation of all relevant stakeholders.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

}

\caption{From an ideal RBM system to the roadmaps}\label{fig:figure6}
\end{figure}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

The whole process has a coproduction approach, were aside of the CLEAR LAC team, the CARICOM Secretariat, and the Executive Coordinators, key stakeholders will be involved in a fluid process to develop a learning loop for feedback and process improvement.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{./images/figure_7} 

}

\caption{Learning loop}\label{fig:figure7}
\end{figure}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

This report is considered as the \emph{starting point} in this process; take into consideration that, as \protect\hyperlink{fig:figure7}{figure 7} illustrates, the process started before its publication.

Once the first draft was completed, it will be shared with key stakeholders for review and validation, starting with the Executive Coordinators. Once the feedback period concluded, the report itself became an input for what is to come and will be distributed with multiple purposes (including generating knowledge, aiding in empowering key stakeholders in the path of strengthening RBM practices, and promoting appropriation of the next steps).

The next steps start with \emph{defining the road}, engaging key stakeholders to coproduce contextualized mid-term roadmaps that will include specific activities and milestones that sought to materialize their implementation. To develop the roadmap, the CLEAR LAC team has designed a series of workshops with the participation of stakeholders involved in the different areas and levels of what is to be the national RBM system, and that have been carefully identified as part of the Preparedness Diagnostic process.

To \emph{move forward}, this first draft of the roadmap is presented to other relevant stakeholders to build a consensus and support for the process. It is crucial to gain whole-of-government ownership, so it is important to define and implement a dissemination strategy for \emph{sharing clearly define milestones} in different levels: internal, external, and regional once they have been clearly defined and responsibilities have been assigned. Finally, it is important to \emph{track the progress} of implementation and communicate results to assure that the Member State learns from the process, adjusts, and stays on the recommended path, as well as communicating results. The continuum process of identifying, sharing, reviewing, and adjusting represents a learning loop.

\hypertarget{stakeholders-contribution-analysis}{%
\section{Stakeholders' contribution analysis}\label{stakeholders-contribution-analysis}}

This section presents an analysis of stakeholders to identify which of them are relevant to strengthening the RBM system, identifying the main actors that should be involved in the process. Each of these stakeholders are involved in the decision making and execution at varied levels. Based on the CLEAR LAC's team analysis, a proposal of the possible contribution of the stakeholders (considering positions and experience) is summarised below to support the improvement of the system which will generate the necessary evidence and results for decision-making regarding planning, budgeting and thus achieve the expected results of the GoJ is presented here based on the CLEAR LAC's team analysis considering their positions and experience.

The analysis is summarized in the following table (the list of stakeholders that could take part of the RBM systems is not limited to those presented in Table 3; due to the continuous changes in dynamics within governments and other contextual factors, additional stakeholders may become relevant). During the roadmap development workshops that will be held with government stakeholders, new stakeholders could be identified or some of those presented here could be discarded. For the special case of Jamaica, it is important to recognize that, once its RBM Policy is approved and published, we will be able to have greater clarity on the roles, responsibilities, capacities, and relevance of the stakeholders that will integrate the system both at MDA and whole-of-government approach.

\section{Key dimensions of a sustainable RBM System}\label{key-dimensions-of-a-sustainable-rbm-system}}

The development of an RBM System is a complex and nonlinear process that must be contextualized to the specific region, country, or regional institution. However, the multiple efforts done over time allow us to learn from experiences in different settings and identify good practices. These good practices represent useful inputs to be considered when embarked on this road.

One significant component to strengthen RBM in the Community is to build, in a participatory process, specific roadmaps to continue the development of RBM Systems for each pilot member state and regional institution. The member states and regional institutions participating in the pilot have significant but heterogeneous advances achieving this goal. To identify these advances and guide the analysis of the Preparedness Diagnostic stages, the CLEAR LAC team defined four dimensions of an ideal and sustainable RBM System:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Institutionalisation:} this dimension focuses on the formal rules that defines, outlines and formalize the RBM Systems in the countries.
\item
  \emph{Execution framework:} this dimension focuses on the systems, resources, processes, methodologies, and tools necessary for the implementation of the RBM system, as well as incentives that promote an enabling environment.
\item
  \emph{Technical capabilities:} this dimension focuses on the capacities, abilities, and resources necessary to implement and sustain the RBM System.
\item
  \emph{Use of evidence:} this dimension focuses on the dissemination strategies and incentives aimed at stakeholders with the purpose that they use the evidence generated by the RBM System and its measurement.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ideal-elements-sub-elements}{%
\section{Ideal elements \& sub-elements}\label{ideal-elements-sub-elements}}

The four dimensions previously mentioned were conceptualized as necessary components when building an operating and sustainable RBM system. To have a better understanding of what the progress in each dimension entails, we propose a set of ideal elements and sub-elements taken from different contexts and experiences where they have been successfully implemented or recommended. Each dimension has a set of elements that represent activities, documents, normative frameworks, skills, incentives, etc.; and every element has a set of sub-elements that describe the ideal characteristics of the element. The sub-elements allow to translate concepts into practice, and, after gathering and analysing information, this knowledge can be translated into specific actions.

Unlike the dimensions, as RBM Systems are designed and built considering contextual factors, some elements and sub-elements should be taken as a guide as different contexts will result in variations on their interpretation and level of relevance/priorities. This framework allows for adaptations, recognizing that every context is particular and that there is no unique checklist that may apply to all contexts.

\section{Levels of progress}\label{levels-of-progress}}

The Preparedness Diagnostic methodology is designed to gain a deep understanding of a country or institution's relevant aspects/characteristics when developing an RBM System. The different stages are meant to gather information from different stakeholders to achieve a whole of government / institutional outlook. The dimensions with ideal elements and sub-elements guide the analysis of the information gathered in order to identify the level of progress of a specific government or institution.

The scale used to assess the sub-elements are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  No: there is no documented advance in the sub-element
\item
  Needs improvement: there is documented advance in the sub-element, but do not cover all the criteria express in the sub-element.
\item
  Yes: there is documented proof that the sub-element complies with the needed/ideal characteristics
\end{itemize}

Each scale level has an assigned value, and every element will have a result obtained from the total sum of its sub-element's scores. The average score of the elements per dimension results in the dimension's score, and the average score of the four dimensions will place the Member state/regional Institution in one of the following \textbf{levels of progress} of their RBM Systems:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Level 0. No RBM
\item
  Level 1. Early initiatives: there are some initiatives to develop RBM-related structures and focus on monitoring activities
\item
  Level 2. Committed development: there are RBM-related structures being stablished and limited evaluation activities
\item
  Level 3.. Growing RBM system: there are RBM-related structures being stablished and limited evaluation activities
\item
  Level 4. Consolidated practices: there are integrated efforts (political will, capacity building and some whole-of-government consensus) to develop the RBM System
\item
  Level 5. Mature state: Functioning and sustainable RBM System in place that generates credible, reliable and timely information that improves public policies
\end{itemize}

Jamaica has strategic planning templates that are used by all Ministries. Departments and Agencies are guided by the Minimum Standards. This use is based on compliance basis and the information is not always used to improve planning and budgeting.\\
\hline
\hspace{1em}3.4 They integrate the indicators as a monitoring system & Vision 2030 does have a set of indicators, timeframes and the responsible MDAs to ensure data collection but there are no instruments in place to systematize M\&E results/findings/data.\\

\hline
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{6. There are formal actions towards building an enabling environment}}\\
\hline
\hspace{1em}6.1 There are key stakeholders identified as responsible for these formal actions & Incentives to enable the demand for monitoring: The Parliament of Jamaica in exercising its scrutiny and oversight roles through its committees (e.g., Public Administration and Appropriations Committee which inquiries into the efficient administration of the Government and monitors if the expenditure by Government agencies is undertaken in accordance with parliamentary approval) generate demand for monitoring activities.\\
\hline
\hspace{1em}6.2 There are strategies to enhance or attenuate positive or negative incentives for the use of monitoring & There is a negative incentive for stakeholders for monitoring because the Public Administration and Appropriations Committee and PMES's performance oversee processes are not binding; also, the recommendations are not considered to improve decision making.\\

\hline
\hspace{1em}8.1 It is allocated according to the objectives/goals/activities of the national planning & There is alignment between the government´s budgeting process and the MTF and Vision 2030, however, budget allocation is determined mainly by the level of government´s income, not according to the objectives/goals/activities of the national planning.\\
\hline
\hspace{1em}8.2 It considers the prioritization of the objectives/goals/activities identified in the national planning & Some KPIs are taken into account in the budget so that they can be tracked identifying how ministries are using their resources to improve outputs related to the KPIs.\\
\hline
\hspace{1em}8.3 It is allocated using the information generated by evidence and the RBM System & RBM and M\&E information/findings are not used in budgeting or planning.\\

\hline
\hspace{1em}11.7 It is sufficiently funded (specific financial resources are allocated) & The PMEB and PMES are not sufficiently funded for M\&E activities. Also, evaluations are mostly done for internationally funded programmes because they allocate money for doing so. Internally it is less common to have M\&E activities because of the lack of resources.\\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{12. There is a defined human resources structure for M\&E activities:}}\\
\hline
\hspace{1em}12.1 It has specific focal points in each MDA across the government & MDAs have internal M\&E technical groups that are mostly focused on monitoring. Vision 2030 defines they are supposed to be Technical Monitoring Committee(s) that should be responsible of 1) reporting the process of implementation of programmes and activities; 2) to give those reports to relevant stakeholders. However, this has not been established yet.\\

\hline
\hspace{1em}12.3 The MDA focal points have clear functions, responsibilities and expected outcomes & The MOFPS is charged with the responsibility of implementing the Medium-Term Results-Based Budgeting (MTRBB) in MDAs. MTRBB approach requires, in the preparation of annual budgets, an alignment of results to spend. But there are no designated focal points in MDAs across government for doing that task. Also, there are different capacities among MDAs, and there are no homogeneous structures within them regarding M\&E (e.g., a unit dedicated only to M\&E activities).\\

Jamaica's planning process is consistent over time and identifies the times, resources, and personnel necessary to carry it out. The process can be synthesized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The Cabinet determines the priorities of the Government for the short and medium terms based on the National Development Plan Vision 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the Government´s political objects (usually before September 30).
\item
